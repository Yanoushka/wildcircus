     		<p>Once upon a time...<span class="credit">(Photo : View of the Wild Circus in New York City)</span><br /> <small>The Wild Circus company has been established in 1856 by two brothers, Achille Zavetti and Pipo Zavetti.<br /> At the beginning they started to earn money by doing acrobating shows in the streets of Florencia (Italia). They were so talented that a rich entrepreneur, called Donaldo Trumpetta, offered them the opportunity to find other artists, animals and invested to create a circus. The success story started there.<br />Today, the Wild Circus company is doing tours all over the world for more than 100 years now, and the Zavetti's family is a big part of that success.</small></p>
